## Get Involved

There are loads of reasons to get involved with PGS whilst you are studying at Strathclyde. Not only is it the easiest way for you to meet other PGS students, make new friends and gain new skills but we are also here to ensure your study and research is as stress free as possible by making sure all the support you need is put in place at either the Union or the University.
There is so much more to a MSc/ MRes/PhD than the walls around you.

The word “university” is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means “community of teachers and scholars.” Be part of that community.
