The society puts on a series of events throughout the year (not just during term time). The best place to keep track of the events is via the events section of our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pgstrath/events).

### Weekly Events

- Postgrads do Lunch, Friday 1230-1330 at our PG Lounge in the Student's Union. Come, bring your food and join us for our end-of-the-week lunch. All members, old and new, are welcome to join. You bring the lunch and we supply the cake!

- [Badminton, Friday 1700-1800](http://www.facebook.com/groups/pgstrathbadminton) at the Uni's CSR (Centre for Sport and Recreation). We book one court a week, which is suited for up to 6 people. There is a sign up sheet sent out via our weekly email.

### Monthly Events

- [Monthly Social, around payday (the 28th)](http://www.facebook.com/pgstrath) at various locations throughout the city! We try to vary the locations between the city centre, east and west ends.
