## Glasgow Life

Many of you will be coming to Glasgow for the first time and might not know very much about the city. If you’re looking for things to do and places to go, we’ll try to show you some at our events, but you can also check out [The List](http://www.list.co.uk/), [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g186534-Glasgow_Scotland-Vacations.html) or [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/glasgow) for some ideas. If you’re looking for a place to stay, we’ve got some resources to help you below.

## Places to Stay

This guide provides a short description of the central areas of Glasgow as well as a price range for renting there. Each price is ‘per calendar month’ (pcm) for a 2 bedroom flat. Full-time students should be exempt from paying council tax and part-time students may be eligible for a discount. Certificates of student status can be obtained through [Student Business](http://www.strath.ac.uk/studentlifecycle/letterscounciltaxbankstatus/).

### City Centre
> Areas on map: City Centre
>
> Price Range: £575 – £1000 pcm

The city centre of Glasgow is the busiest area of the city, but is also one of the areas with most to offer. Living here allows proximity to hosts of restaurants, bars, cafés and clubs, as well as good transport links elsewhere by bus, subway and rail. Glasgow airport is only a 25 minute bus journey away. The University of Strathclyde itself is situated here, so you’ll only be a short walk away.

Renting in the city centre can be more expensive than renting further afield, though the prices are much cheaper than the likes of Edinburgh, Aberdeen or London. Flats here tend to be more modern, though can be smaller than other areas of the city where space is not at as much of a premium.

### West End

> Areas on map: Hillhead, Woodlands, Yorkhill, Anderston, Partick, Hyndland
>
> Price Range: £500 – £1200 pcm

The west end is Glasgow’s traditional student area. Home to Glasgow University, the west end boasts its own collection of cafés, fine dining and restaurants, and night life. Travel to the city centre is easy via subway, train from Partick station or any number of buses. If you fancy a walk it should take about 45 minutes.

Living in the west end is the most expensive as far as Glasgow goes, though can still be very affordable. The flats here are generally older and more expensive to heat than others, but you’re rewarded with high ceilings and larger rooms.

### East End

> Areas on map: Dennistoun, Bridgeton, Gallowgate, Parkhead
>
> Price Range: £300 – £650 pcm

Historically, the east end contained a large proportion of Glasgow’s industry (notably, the Parkhead Forge steelworks), and also housed the thousands of families who made their living there. Now that the industry has moved on, these areas tend to be almost entirely residential. Housing varies greatly from area to area, with new build properties next to much older red sandstone tenements. Travel to and from the city centre can be made by bus, train from Bellgrove, Duke St or Alexandra Park stations, and walking will take approximately 20–30 minutes from Dennistoun and Gallowgate (Bridgeton and Parkhead, 40–50 minutes).

Living in the east end can be a bit of a mixed bag. Dennistoun is a popular student area relatively close to the city centre, and contains many new and old, spacious flats for a very affordable price. Gallowgate is also close to the city centre and hosts the famous Barrowlands music venue, but is considered a rougher area with a higher crime rate. Bridgeton and Parkhead both suffer from the same, as well the impact of football crowds travelling to Parkhead stadium, and so the prices here reflect that.

### South Side

> Areas on map: Tradeston, The Gorbals, Pollockshields, Ibrox
>
> Price Range: £500 – £800 pcm

These areas of Glasgow are, again, mainly residential; some, after years of redevelopment. Ibrox and Pollockshields boast the same well-built red sandstone tenements found in many other parts of the city, while Tradeston and the Gorbals are significantly newer. Travel to the city centre is possible using subway or bus, and walking will take 20–45 minutes.

Living here you’ll get more space for your money, with flats being generally quite large. Ibrox does contain Ibrox stadium, home of Glasgow Rangers, and so has to cope with the impact of the football crowds.


### North Glasgow

> Areas on map: Port Dundas, Sighthill
>
> Price Range: £400 – £650 pcm

The areas of Glasgow immediately north of the city centre are home to old factories and multiple high rise flats. Port Dundas is in the process of being redeveloped, though many older properties still remain. Sighthill is a housing estate within the larger area of Springburn. Travel is limited to bus and by foot, though the time to walk to the city centre is only 15–20 minutes.
